## Overview
The project was built over four phases:

Build components in isolation: We'll start with those at the outermost nodes of the component tree (e.g. buttons, individual list items). and work our way up the tree to the components that need to use the ones built first.
Retrieve data from an API and render the data using components.
Manage the visual state of the application including create, edit and delete capabilities.
Implement advanced React patterns to manage the state and add live updates.
Instruction


## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Running Webpack Development Server
We need to be able to quickly and easily see the effect of our changes to the project. The webpack-dev-server provides a live environment that updates the the browser when a file is saved.
```sh
npm start
```

## Running Jest Test Framework
A test environment is an important consideration for any project. The ability to run tests using the Jest testing framework is built-in to the project. We will use Jest to implement a few features using test driven development.
```sh
npm test
```

## Running Storybook Visual Testbed
The Storybook environment is designed to speed up the development and testing of individual components. The benefits will become more evident as an application scales.
```sh
npm run storybook
```
